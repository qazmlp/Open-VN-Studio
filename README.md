# Open VN Studio

Just sketching…

## Licensing

This software is licensed under [MPL 2.0](./LICENSE.txt) on a per-file basis. This is noted in each file of the Source Code Form or, where not otherwise useful, in a `FOLDER-LICENSE-…` file.

Some meta data and configuration files in this repository are dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal, which is equally noted per file or folder.

## Target Platforms

For the runtime, ensure that everything functions across the current stable versions of Firefox, Chromium and Safari. There will also be an option to package apps for the desktop and ideally, eventually, Android and iOS.

The editor will be stand-alone, more or less, so anything that works in current stable Chromium is fine. (This project really benefits from Module Worker availability.)

## Contributing

This project accepts contributions under the unmodified MPL-2.0 without incompatibility with secondary licenses.

Please add your copyright information to the license header of files you modify or contribute, unless you are making only automatic changes without effect at runtime, like source code formatting and white space changes.

Please refer to [Mozilla License Headers](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/headers/) for examples of license headers to use.
